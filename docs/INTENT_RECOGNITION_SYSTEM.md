# Intent Recognition System for Somjeed Credit Card Customer Support

## Overview

The Intent Recognition System enables Somjeed to understand and respond to user queries in natural language by classifying messages into predefined intents and generating contextual responses.

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Architecture Components

1. **IntentRecognitionService**: Classifies user messages into intents
2. **IntentResponseService**: Generates contextual responses based on classified intents
3. **UserIntent DTO**: Represents classified intent with confidence and entities
4. **Entity Extraction**: Extracts relevant information (amounts, merchants, dates)

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/chat/message` - Process chat messages with intent recognition
- `GET /api/chat/classify?message=<text>` - Test intent classification
- `GET /api/chat/health` - Health check

### Entity Extraction

The system extracts relevant entities from user messages:

- **AMOUNT**: Monetary values (e.g., "1,000", "500.00")
- **MERCHANT**: Store/company names (e.g., "Amazon", "Starbucks")
- **DATE/MONTH**: Time references (e.g., "January", "last month")
- **ACTION**: Card actions (e.g., "block", "replace", "activate")

### Confidence Scoring

- **High (90-96%)**: Clear intent with specific keywords
- **Medium (80-89%)**: Probable intent with some ambiguity
- **Low (50-79%)**: Uncertain classification, may need clarification

## üß™ Testing Examples

### Payment Inquiry
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/chat/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What is my current balance?"}'
```

### Transaction Dispute
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/chat/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "I want to dispute a charge from Amazon for 500 THB"}'
```

### Card Management
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/chat/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

```

### Intent Classification Testing
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/chat/classify?message=I%20want%20to%20check%20my%20balance"
```
